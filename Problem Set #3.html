<h4 align="CENTER"> Due: Nov 10th, 2015</h4>

1.  Consider the finite field GF(16) with irreducible polynomial
m(x) = x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + 1.  (You'll have to trust me that m(x)
is irreducible over F<sub>2</sub> here.) We will, as usual, represent
group elements as either polynomials in <em>x</em>, or a hex number, or 
binary strings, with the usual mapping between these representations.
<br>
<b>(a)</b> What polynomial corresponds to the hex number 'a'?
<br>
<b>(b)</b> What is 'a' + '7' in this field?
<br>
<b>(c)</b> What is 'a' * '7' in this field?
<br>
<b>(d)</b> What is the additive inverse of 'e' in this field?
<br>
<b>(e)</b> What is the multiplicative inverse of 'e' in this field?  (Try
elements exhaustively using the <b>xtime()</b> method and show your work. 
You can use Euclid's algorithm if you know it.)
<p>
2. We said in class that MixColumn on a column with exactly one active
cell, and the rest constant, converts to all cells active.  Prove this.
</p><p>
In order to have a convincing proof, first write down carefully what it is
we are claiming here.  Then do the algebra in the proper ring or field to
show that the claim must be true.
</p><p>
3. Please implement the 4-round attack against Rijndael.
</p><p>
First, download the <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/class/csci7000a/f15/hw/rijndael-fst-3.0.zip">Rijndael source</a>
to your computer and unzip it and build it (for Unix, just run <tt>make</tt>;
you might have to add the line <tt>CC=gcc</tt> if the cc compiler does not
exist on your machine).  Then download a program
I wrote <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/class/csci7000a/f15/hw/4rnds.c">4rnds.c</a> and build it.  For unix
</p><pre>  % gcc rijndael-alg-fst.o 4rnds.c -o 4rnds
</pre>
If you examine the source to <tt>4rnds.c</tt>, you'll
see that I have the number of rounds (<tt>AES_ROUNDS</tt>) set to 4,
and the key is set to all 0's.  Run <tt>4rnds</tt>
and make sure you get the same output as
<a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/class/csci7000a/f15/hw/4rnds-zero-key.out">what I got.</a>
<p>
Ok, now here's your goal: I ran this same program, <tt>4rnds.c</tt>, with a
<b>different</b> key which I'm not telling you, but the same plaintexts
(which happen to be very nice for the Square attack, as you can see from
the source code).  Under this secret key, I got <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/class/csci7000a/f15/hw/4rnds-sec-key.out">
256 ciphertexts</a> which you now will use to mount the attack.
</p><p>
The answer to this problem is the value of that secret key.  This means
you'll have to study the key schedule, but that's not too hard.  Along with
your answer, please provide the well-documented source code you used to
crack this cipher.
</p><p>
You probably will get <b>several</b> candidate
keys.  You can narrow these down by trying each of them on the following
plaintext/ciphertext pair (which uses the same secret key you are looking
for).  If there is still more than one candidate key which works, please
hand in all that you found.

4. (Grad students only; Undergrads can do this for Extra Credit)
Define blockcipher X as follows: X has a 128-bit blocksize and
a 12800-bit key K.  K is broken into 100 chunks of 128-bits each, 
K<sub>1</sub> through K<sub>100</sub>.
Blockcipher X(K, P) is like this: C<sub>0</sub>=P and
C<sub>i</sub>=S(C<sub>i-1</sub> &#8853; K<sub>i</sub>), where S(&#8901;) is 
inversion in GF(2<sup>128</sup>) (where 0 goes to 0 as usual).
The output of the blockcipher is C<sub>100</sub>.  Break this thing.
</p><p>
Details: Our irreducible polynomial of degree 128 will be
x<sup>128</sup>+x<sup>7</sup>+x<sup>2</sup>+x+1.  This is irreducible over
GF(2).  I have taken a publicly-available library
<a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/class/csci7000a/f15/hw/ffield.py">ffield.py</a>
and added this modulus
to it so we can compute easily in python in this field.
Instructions are contained in the source code.
</p><p>
Now it's quite easy to implement cipher X as described above:
</p><pre>import ffield
import keylist

F = ffield.FField(128)

def encipher(x):
    for i in range(100):
        x = F.Inverse(F.Add(x, keylist.key[i]))
    return x

def decipher(x):
    for i in reversed(range(100)):
        x = F.Add(F.Inverse(x), keylist.key[i])
    return x
</pre>
where keylist.py is a file just listing the 100 round keys.  If you want a
random 12,800 bit master key, you can use this python code to generate one
and then save its output to keylist.py (which will make the above code work):
<pre>import random

print "keys = ["
for i in range(99):
    k = random.getrandbits(128)
    print k, ','
print random.getrandbits(128), ']'
</pre>
Using these techniques, I have created my own 12,800 bit random key
and enciphered the three plaintexts 0L, 1L, and 2L.  Their corresponding
ciphertexts in decimal are
<pre>131561246017920334936828440555437427465L
248729583318336296365530932515022212932L
248633568239107965830560009361047375509L
</pre>
After you have broken this thing, you won't have the key I used, but you
will be able to decipher any ciphertext I give you.  Please hand in the
decipherment of the ciphertext
<tt>330927140779763012830194718016277696816L</tt> along with your
source code.  Note this can be done in 5 lines of python.  Finding the right
5 lines should, however, be fairly challenging.
